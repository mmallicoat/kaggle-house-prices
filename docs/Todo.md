# Todo

*   Restructure model to separate data prep from training,
    and training from testing a model.
*   Implement a learning curve to see whether the model is over-
    or under-fitting
*   If over-fitting, add regularization. If under-fitting, try
    adding more features.
*   To determine which features to add, maybe try using decision
    trees / random forest? Or look a correlations between indep.
    variables and the response variable?

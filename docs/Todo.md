# Todo

1. Split out cross-validation data set from training set
2. Implement simple linear regression model using same features they suggest
3. Implement a learning curve to see whether the model is over- or under-fitting
4. If over-fitting, add regularization. If under-fitting, try adding more features.
5. To determine which features to add, maybe try using decision trees? Or look a correlations between indep. variables and the response variable?
